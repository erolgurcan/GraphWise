Here’s a **GraphWise Roadmap section** you can append to your README — it’s written to align with your learning and project goals (Neo4J, Azure DevOps, AI Agents, ETL pipelines, and Angular).

## 🧭 Project Roadmap — *GraphWise*

GraphWise will evolve in well-defined phases to progressively integrate Data Engineering, AI, and DevOps best practices.

### **Phase 1 — Infrastructure & Data Engineering (Weeks 1–3)**

**Goal:** Build a robust and automated foundation for data ingestion and storage.
**Tasks:**

* [⏳ In Progress] Create Docker Compose for Neo4j and ETL pipeline container.
* [ ] Implement Python ETL pipeline for historic and incremental loads (hourly scheduler via `cron` or Azure Function Timer Trigger).
* [ ] Integrate with a free stock market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Finnhub).
* [ ] Store ticker-level data (`Company`, `Holding`, `Transaction`) in Neo4j schema.
* [ ] Add logging, error handling, and retry logic in ETL jobs.
* [ ] Configure data versioning or metadata tagging in Neo4j for incremental loads.

---

### **Phase 2 — Backend API Layer (Weeks 4–5)**

**Goal:** Build a data access and transformation layer on top of Neo4j.
**Tasks:**

* [ ] Create a Python FastAPI service with native Neo4j driver integration.
* [ ] Expose REST and GraphQL endpoints for portfolio analytics.
* [ ] Implement caching with Redis for recent queries.
* [ ] Integrate basic authentication and JWT-based session management.
* [ ] Add unit tests with `pytest` and mock Neo4j connections.

---

### **Phase 3 — Frontend Application (Weeks 6–7)**

**Goal:** Create a dynamic Angular dashboard for portfolio visualization.
**Tasks:**

* [ ] Bootstrap Angular 17 app (`graphwise-ui`).
* [ ] Implement components for:

  * [ ] Portfolio overview (value, gain/loss, sectors)
  * [ ] Stock detail with real-time charts
  * [ ] Alerts & signals panel
* [ ] Integrate with FastAPI endpoints.
* [ ] Add D3.js or ngx-charts visualization for relationships (Neo4j graph view).
* [ ] Configure CI/CD in Azure DevOps for automatic deployment.

---

### **Phase 4 — AI Agent Integration (Weeks 8–10)**

**Goal:** Enable AI-assisted insights for the portfolio.
**Tasks:**

* [ ] Integrate Microsoft Semantic Kernel or LangChain.
* [ ] Create agents to:

  * [ ] Summarize stock performance and trends.
  * [ ] Generate portfolio rebalancing suggestions.
  * [ ] Explain investment risks using LLM.
* [ ] Store insights as `Signal` nodes in Neo4j.

---

### **Phase 5 — DevOps & Observability (Weeks 11–12)**

**Goal:** Automate, monitor, and scale the system.
**Tasks:**

* [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
* [ ] Containerize ETL and backend services.
* [ ] Add monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana.
* [ ] Enable Neo4j backup and data retention policies.
* [ ] Deploy infrastructure via Terraform (optional).

---

### **Stretch Goals**

* [ ] Integrate email/SMS alerting system via Azure Logic Apps.
* [ ] Build chatbot UI for portfolio queries.
* [ ] Add predictive models for stock performance (using Azure ML).
* [ ] Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for multi-user support.
